# Privacy Preserving Data Collection for Generative AI

  The objective of this research is to evaluate comprehensive privacy-preserving techniques such as differential privacy, data anonymization, and synthetic data generation for effectively and securely training generative AI models in a healthcare ecosystem.

The goal of this research is to determine how privacy-preserving techniques can be effectively implemented in the data collection and training processes of generative AI models used in healthcare, ensuring effective data privacy while maintaining data utility and scalability. The specific research questions are: 

1. How effective are the privacy-preserving techniques (differential privacy, data anonymization, and synthetic data generation) in minimizing data leakage and re-identification risks during the training of generative AI models on healthcare data?

2. What is the impact of implementing privacy-preserving techniques on the data utility of healthcare datasets, as measured by the Perplexity, ROUGE scores, and Human Evaluation of AI models trained on privacy-preserved healthcare datasets?.

3. How scalable and computationally efficient are the implemented privacy-preserving techniques in the context of real-world healthcare AI applications?
